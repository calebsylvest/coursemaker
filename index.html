			<h3>I've never taught anything before, is CourseMakers for me?</h3>

			<p>Yes, of course! Our goal with CourseMakers is to give anyone interested the opportunity to create an online course to teach others, no matter what your level of&nbsp;experience.</p>

			<h3>I'm not sure what type of course I could make?</h3>

			<p>That's a common concern that many people face, but an easy one to solve! Each of us have <em>something</em> that we are skilled and passionate about. Ask yourself, what are you good at and enjoy a lot? Maybe you are good with jQuery, or PHP frameworks,  or you're an iOS designer, or you're really into crafting brands for startups. You can come up with something, and if you need help brainstorming ideas <a href="#sign-up">signup for CourseMakers</a> and respond to the introductory email, we would be happy to help you figure out what type of course you could&nbsp;make.</p>

			<h3>I don't think anyone would be interested in what I have to say? or, I'm not an expert so I can't teach.</h3>

			<p>You don't have to be an <em>expert</em> to teach, you only need to know and understand who your <em>target audience</em> is. The audience that is most similar to you are your peers and the people just behind you in experience and knowledge. So if I'm a mid-level UX Designer I would want to craft a course for either other mid-level UX Designers or people new to UX design, because I can still relate to and remember what it was like to be in that&nbsp;position.</p>

			<h3>How do I get people to signup for my course?</h3>

			<p>	You can gain eyeballs on your course by promoting through personal networks, social media, target communities, and email newsletters. Find which works best for your course and hit hard. We'll help with promotion as&nbsp;well!</p>

			<h3>How much does CourseMakers cost?</h3>

			<p>CourseMakers is completely free to use. We will take a small percentage fee when students buy a course to keep CourseMakers running and build out improvements and new&nbsp;features.</p>

			<h3>When can I get started?</h3>

			<p>Right now! <a href="#sign-up">Signup for CourseMakers</a> and we will get in touch with you right away. The most important thing to build a successful course is the content, so you can start creating the course content right away, when you are ready to prep for launch we will deploy the course for&nbsp;you.</p>
